# 05 WorkDay Scheduler


## Description

This project had some starter code. The main goal of this project challenge was to utilize jquery and javascript and create a basic functioning scheduler for the day and make it save with localstorage upon refresh. I learned the "shorthand" ways to use Jquery instead of JS. It helped solve the problem of not being able to see what hour of the day it was with the date in the header but also solved it going along and color coating as the day went on upon refresh which had some seriously interesting syntax. I learned jQuery better although it was my first time working with it and expect to use ti more, I would like to become proficient with it. I also figured out how to ad and remove classes and attributes better. WHile the syntax is shorter I was able to correlate it with the vanilla JS i have worked with which isn't a ton as of yet. All together it has taught me a solid foundation I would like to build upon and solidify even more in the coming weeks.

## Installation

If needing to view the code in an IDE download or open this code with VsCode (my preference). Then open it and run it using control B on a Mac. You can also find the link to the deployed project below in this README.

## Usage

Using this you can input your items. It can be anything that can be typed in your selected hour of the day. If needing to save it, click the save button on the right side correlating with the desired hour. This will save it to local storage using JavaScript and Jquery in the background. Then if the page refreshs for any reason the item that was put in there will still be there for the workday.
